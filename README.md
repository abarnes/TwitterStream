# TwitterStream
The Twitter Stream is a quick way to stream Tweets containing certain keywords (not just hashtags), enabling you to respond to them in real time. It was built as a tool for the Vendevor sales team. 

This project uses a modified version of the Twitter OAuth class written by Mike Pultz.
